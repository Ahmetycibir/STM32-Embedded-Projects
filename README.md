##  Project Overview

This repository contains a series of STM32F4-based projects designed to explore embedded systems, sensor interfacing, and actuator control.
Projects include beginner to advanced examples using:

* **RTC (DS3231)**
* **DHT11 temperature & humidity sensor**
* **Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)**
* **RFID module (RC522)**
* **Servo motors (SG90)**
* **Stepper motors (28BYJ-48 + ULN2003)**
* **Keypads (4x4)**
* **LCD displays (1602 / I2C)**
* **LED matrix (8x8, MAX7219)**
* **Bluetooth modules (HC-05 / HC-06)**
* **Buzzer, push buttons, potentiometers, diodes, transistors**
